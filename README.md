Kaggle has a recent dataset of gathered US Auto Accidents.  The accident contain Lat Lng location information so we plan to clean the data and make visualization clustering the accident markers to analyze high volume areas.

Then we plan to collect GEO JSON data on those high volume accident areas to make another visualization representing the start-end lat lngs for the accidents and representing them in neightborhood areas such as the Portland neighborhood information listed below.

We also plan the factor in the severity of the accidents aligned with the neighborhoods or separately based on our analysis.
